.. code-block:: bash

    $ cd /path/to/nginx-utilities
    $ git config --local commit.template `$(pwd)`/commit.template

After that, you will need add your changes and commit in the following way

    $ git add .
    $ git commit
    $ # Do the necessary changes and fill the requested information
    $ git commit -F .git/COMMIT_EDITMSG
